# Blog Posts

These are all of the blog posts currently up on www.samiser.xyz in their raw
markdown form.

The web app uses python's Markdown module with the CodeHilite extention to
process the markdown into HTML.

If you wanted to render these posts yourself you would have to change the
image paths in the posts since they currently point to where the images
are stored on the server.
