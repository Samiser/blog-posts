# Blog Posts

These are all of the blog posts currently up on www.samiser.xyz in their raw
markdown form.

The web app uses python's Markdown module with the CodeHilite extention to
process the markdown into HTML.

The image paths in these files are different to how they are on the actual server.
This way github can render the posts with the images correctly.
